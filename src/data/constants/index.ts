An introvert is a person who tends to be more focused on their inner thoughts, feelings, and experiences rather than the external world. They may be quieter and more reserved in social situations, preferring to listen and observe rather than actively engage in conversation. Introverts often need time alone to recharge their energy, as being around others for extended periods can be mentally and emotionally draining.
Introverts may also have a smaller circle of close friends, and prefer to spend time in one-on-one or small group settings rather than large social gatherings. They may find it challenging to initiate small talk or approach new people, but can often thrive in deeper, more meaningful conversations.
